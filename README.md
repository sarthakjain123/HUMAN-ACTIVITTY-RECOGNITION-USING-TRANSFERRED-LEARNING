# HUMAN-ACTIVITTY-RECOGNITION-USING-TRANSFERRED-LEARNING
The Project is a deep learning model for action recognition using images of people walking or running. The model is built using CNN with the Inception V3 pre-trained model and fine-tuned on a dataset of walking and running images. The model is trained using data augmentation techniques and achieves a high accuracy on the validation set.
